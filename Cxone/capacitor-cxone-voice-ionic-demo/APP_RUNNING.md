# CXONE Voice Demo App - Running Successfully! ðŸŽ‰

The Ionic/Angular demo app is now running without build errors!

## Access the App

The development server is running on the Angular default port:

**http://localhost:4200**

## Current Status

âœ… **Build Successful** - The app compiles without errors
âœ… **Server Running** - Development server is active on port 4200
âœ… **Demo Mode Active** - Voice features are simulated for web testing

## What's Working

1. **All UI Components**:
   - Dialer with keypad
   - Call history 
   - Settings page
   - Active call screen
   - Incoming call screen

2. **Voice Service (Demo Mode)**:
   - Simulated outbound calls
   - Simulated incoming calls
   - Mock audio levels
   - Call state management
   - Call history persistence

## Build Warnings

The app shows some CSS warnings related to Ionic's :host-context and :dir pseudo-classes. These are harmless and don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps

To enable real voice features:

1. **Complete the Capacitor plugin build**:
   ```bash
   cd ../capacitor-cxone-voice
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Link the plugin**:
   ```bash
   cd ../capacitor-cxone-voice-ionic-demo
   npm install ../capacitor-cxone-voice
   npx cap sync
   ```

3. **Add CXONE credentials** in `src/environments/environment.ts`

4. **Build for target platforms**:
   - iOS: `ionic cap build ios`
   - Android: `ionic cap build android`

## Stopping the Server

To stop the development server:
```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep "ng serve"

# Kill it
kill <PID>
```

Or simply close the terminal where it's running.

## Troubleshooting

If you need to restart:
```bash
npm start
```

The app is now ready for development and testing!
