# CXONE Integration Status

## Current State âœ…

The app now builds successfully with a CXONE integration facade that provides:

1. **Configuration Support**: The app can be configured with CXONE credentials
2. **OAuth Flow Preparation**: Login/logout methods that redirect to CXONE OAuth endpoints
3. **Voice Service Integration**: The voice service can detect CXONE configuration and attempt to use it
4. **Graceful Fallback**: When CXONE is not configured or available, the app falls back to demo mode

## What's Implemented

### CxoneFacadeService (`cxone-facade.service.ts`)
A lightweight service that provides CXONE functionality without the SDK dependencies:
- OAuth login/logout flow
- Configuration management
- Placeholder methods for voice operations
- No complex SDK type dependencies

### Voice Service Integration
- Detects if CXONE credentials are configured
- Attempts to initialize CXONE connection
- Falls back to demo mode if CXONE is unavailable

### Settings Page
- OAuth configuration fields (Tenant ID, Client ID, etc.)
- Login/logout buttons for CXONE
- Service status indicators

## Configuration Required

To use CXONE features, update `src/environments/environment.ts`:

```typescript
cxone: {
  tenantId: 'your-actual-tenant-id',
  clientId: 'your-actual-client-id', 
  clientSecret: '', // Optional
  environment: 'development', // or 'staging', 'production'
  defaultSkillId: 'your-skill-id'
}
```

## OAuth Flow

1. User clicks "Login to CXONE" in Settings
2. App redirects to CXONE OAuth authorize endpoint
3. User logs in and authorizes the app
4. CXONE redirects back to your app with authorization code
5. App would exchange code for access token (implementation pending)

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Implement OAuth Callback Handler**:
   - Create route for `/auth/callback`
   - Exchange authorization code for access token
   - Store token securely

2. **Add Real CXONE SDK**:
   - When SDK type issues are resolved
   - Replace facade methods with actual SDK calls
   - Implement WebRTC for voice

3. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - Establish WebSocket for real-time events
   - Handle incoming call notifications
   - Update call states in real-time

## Current Limitations

- No actual voice communication (facade only)
- OAuth callback handling not implemented
- No WebSocket connection for events
- No real-time call state updates from CXONE

## Demo Mode

When CXONE is not configured or fails to initialize:
- All calls are simulated
- Audio levels are randomly generated
- Call states transition automatically
- Perfect for UI/UX development and testing

The app is now stable and ready for development with a clean architecture that supports both demo mode and future CXONE integration.
