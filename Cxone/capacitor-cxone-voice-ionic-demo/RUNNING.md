# CXONE Voice Demo App is Running! ðŸŽ‰

The Ionic development server is now running successfully!

## Access the App

Open your web browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:8100**

## What You Can Do

1. **Dialer Tab**: 
   - Enter phone numbers using the keypad
   - Add optional display names
   - Make simulated calls (web mode)

2. **History Tab**: 
   - View call history
   - Tap any number to redial

3. **Settings Tab**: 
   - Configure CXONE credentials
   - Check permissions status
   - View service status

## Features in Demo Mode

Since the app is running in web/browser mode, the voice features are simulated:
- Calls will show as "connected" after 2 seconds
- Audio levels are simulated
- Recording playback is mocked
- All permissions show as "granted"

## Stop the Server

To stop the development server:
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Troubleshooting

If you can't access the app:
1. Check if port 8100 is blocked by firewall
2. Try http://127.0.0.1:8100 instead
3. Clear browser cache and refresh

## Next Steps

To test with real voice features:
1. Build for iOS: `ionic cap build ios`
2. Build for Android: `ionic cap build android`
3. Deploy to a device with the CXONE Voice plugin

Enjoy testing the CXONE Voice Demo App!
